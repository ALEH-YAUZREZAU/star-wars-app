## About

Using a third-party API as a data source (example: Star Wars API
https://swapi.dev /), implement a React and Typescript SPA application consisting of two pages.
On the main page, display a list or character cards, add
the possibility of pagination to the list. The search for characters should be implemented on the main page.
Implement a page with detailed information on the selected character.

Positive:

- Neat layout
- - Using the UI framework (Material, Ant, Bootstrap, etc.)
    as an additional task:
- To work with data, use the Redux storage
- Edit character information locally, without sending it to the server
- Write tests
- Filtering on the main page
